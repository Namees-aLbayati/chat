# Group-chat-express
group chat app using express and socket io use it to make a realtime chat conversation between many people;
# Socket.IO is composed of two parts:

A server that integrates with (or mounts on) the Node.JS HTTP Server socket.io
A client library that loads on the browser side socket.io-client
# steps to do chat app
* import express 
* import http (and create server connection with express(serverside))
* import socket.io as a io varaible (and create connection with http)
* so now we have http which has a connection with app(express) to server the page with localhost PORT
AND HAVE THE SECOND CONNECTION WHICH IS SOCKET.IO (which has connection with http);
